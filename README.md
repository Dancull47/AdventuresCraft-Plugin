# AdventuresCraft Minecraft 1.16.5 Plugin

I created this to replace numerous Plugins I previously used, such as: DeluxeMenus, Skript, SpawnerPlaceholders, TextPlaceholder, and probably more which I don't recall. I also hooked into certain plugins like BetonQuest, MythicMobs, & the MMO Suite to make my life easier and include new features.

The quality of the codebase likely isn't great because this was my first big project while and after initially learning Java. I think it's not bad though in terms of performance, as it should never negatively impact your Server.
